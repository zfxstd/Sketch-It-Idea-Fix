# Sketch-It-Idea-Fix
Fixes Sketch It plugin for Intellij Idea.

Seems like developer has abandoned his project and it contains some major bugs, so i did small fix for me. 
At the moment i fixed only namespace error, which causing syntax error sometimes in UML file. 
Im too lazy to upload source code at the moment. But in case if someone need - its should work.

If there need at some other fixes - feel free to create issue.
